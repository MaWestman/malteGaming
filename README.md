# Maltes Gamingsida! — 100-Level Edition

- **100 levels**: difficulty ramps automatically; platform gaps increase; enemy speed/scarcity changes.
- **Enemy sets by bracket**: different spawn mix for levels 1–10, 11–20, … 91–100.
- **Themes recolor enemies** (tinted to match the theme) + platforms and background.
- **Animated skins** from Common → Legendary. Rarity affects **VFX intensity** (more particles for higher rarities).
- **Always spawn on a platform**, squash & stretch, trails, jump sparkles, shadow.
- **Overlay HUD** with a folding menu for mobile, **controls close to the canvas**.
