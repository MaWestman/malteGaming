# Maltes gamingsida! — Full package + Football feed

Everything in one place: kid‑friendly site, **Neon Ascent** (Run Summary, Shop, Stats, Daily Gift), and an auto‑updating **football newsfeed** built via GitHub Actions that writes `/assets/football.json`.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Extract this ZIP into your repo root and commit/push.
2. In **Settings → Pages**: Source = `main`, Folder = `/ (root)`.
3. First feed build: go to **Actions → Fetch football news → Run workflow**. Then it runs every **30 min**.

Links are relative (e.g. `./` for Home, `../../` back link from the game) so it works under a project site.
